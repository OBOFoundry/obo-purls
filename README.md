# OBO PURLs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org)

The OBO community has transitioned away from [PURL.org](http://purl.org) for managing Persistent URLs.

This repository provides a new way to manage OBO Foundry PURLs. Like <https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org> we use per-directory Apache configuration files (`.htaccess` files), each of which uses `RedirectMatch` directives to redirect PURL requests to their proper targets. Unlike w3id.org, we do not edit the Apache configuration files by hand. Instead we have a simple YAML configuration format, and scripts to translate the YAML configuration into Apache configuration. The YAML files are easier to read and write, and allow us to validate and test PURLs automatically.


## Status

All http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ PURLs are now handled by this system, with the exception of some [open issues](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/issues).


## Adding and Updating PURLs

Please use one of these four options to make changes to the PURLs:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/issues/new) describing the change you require.

2. [Browse to the configuration file you want to change](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/tree/master/config) and click the "pencil" icon to edit it.

3. [Add a new configuration file](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/new/master/config).

4. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

All changes are reviewed before they are merged into the `master` branch. Once merged, updated PURLs will be active within 20 minutes.

## Configuration Format

Each OBO project using this service gets a [YAML](http://yaml.org) configuration file in `config/`. That YAML configuration file is used to generate an Apache `.htaccess` file for that ontology. That Apache configuration will apply to all PURLs for that project.

Every YAML configuration file must have these fields:

- `idspace:` the project's [IDSPACE](http://obofoundry.org/id-policy.html), case sensitive, usually uppercase
- `base_url:` the part of a PURL that comes after the domain, usually lowercase
- `term_browser:` usually [`ontobee`](http://ontobee.org) but can be `custom` (see below)
- `products:` a list of primary files for the ontology and the URLs to redirect them to; an `.owl` file is required, and an `.obo` file is optional

Optional fields include:

- `example_terms:` a list of one or more term IDs for automated testing
- `base_redirect:` If your project redirects its `base_url`, then you will need a `base_redirect:` entry. So `base_redirect: http://obi-ontology.org` will redirect <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi> to <http://obi-ontology.org>.
- `entries:` a list of other PURLs under the `base_url`, see below

Here's an example adapted from the [`config/obi.yml`](config/obi.yml) file:

    idspace: OBI
    base_url: /obo/obi

    products:
    - obi.owl: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/obi/code/releases/2015-09-15/obi.owl

    term_browser: ontobee
    example_terms:
    - OBI_0000070

    entries:
    - exact: /wiki
      replacement: http://obi-ontology.org

Most of these fields are straightforward, but the `entries:` need some more explanation.


### Entries

Each YAML configuration file contains the keyword `entries:` followed by a list of entries. Each entry defines an Apache [RedirectMatch](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch) directive for matching URLs and redirecting to new URLs. Every entry begins with a `- `, followed by keywords and values on indented lines. There are three types of entries:

1. **exact**: The simplest entry matches an exact URL and returns an exact replacement
2. **prefix**: These entries match the first part of a URL and replace just that prefix part
3. **regex**: These entries use powerful regular expressions, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

The `#` character indicates a comment, which is not considered part of the configuration.

See the [`tools/examples/test2.yml`](tools/examples/test2.yml) and [`tools/examples/test2.htaccess`](tools/examples/test2.htaccess) for examples.


#### Exact

In the most common case, your PURL should match a unique URL and redirect to a unique URL. Here's an example from the `config/obi.yml` file:

    - exact: /obi.owl
      replacement: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/obi/code/releases/2015-10-20/obi.owl

This entry will match exactly the URL `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/obi.owl`, and it will redirect to exactly `http://svn.code.sf.net/p/obi/code/releases/2015-10-20/obi.owl`. The matched domain name is fixed `http://purl.obolibrary.org`; the next part is project-specific `/obo/obi/`; the final part is taken from the entry `/obi.owl`. The replacement is expected to be a valid, absolute URL, starting with `http`.

Behind the scenes, the entry is translated into a case insensitive Apache RedirectMatch directive in `obo/obi/.htaccess` by escaping special characters and "anchoring" with initial `^`, the project's base URL, and final `$`:

    RedirectMatch temp "(?i)^/2015\-09\-15/obi\.owl$" "http://svn.code.sf.net/p/obi/code/releases/2015-09-15/obi.owl"


#### Prefix

You can also match and replace just the first part of a URL, leaving the rest unchanged. This allows you to define one entry that redirects many URLs matching a common prefix. Another example from `config/obi.yml`:

    - prefix: /branches/
      replacement: http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/

This entry will match the URL `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/branches/obi.owl` (for example), replace the first part `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi/branches/` with `http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/`, resulting in `http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/obi.owl`. Effectively, the `obi.owl` is appended to the replacement.

The translation is similar, with the addition of `(.*)` wildcard and a `$1` "backreference" at the ends of the given strings:

    RedirectMatch temp "(?i)^/branches/(.*)$" "http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/$1"


#### Regex

Regular expression entries should only be needed very rarely, and should always be used very carefully.

For the regular expression type, the value of the `regex:` and `replacement:` keywords should contain regular expressions in exactly the format expected by Apache [RedirectMatch](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch). The values will be quoted, but no other changes will be made to them. Consider using `(?i)` to make the match case insensitive.


#### Tests

Every `prefix` or `regex` entry should also have a `tests:` keyword, with a list of additional URLs to check. Each test requires a `from:` value (like `exact:`) and a `to:` value (like `replacement:`). Here's an example:

    - prefix: /branches/
      replacement: http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/
      tests:
      - from: /branches/obi.owl
        to: http://obi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obi/trunk/src/ontology/branches/obi.owl


#### Order of Entries

Apache RedirectMatch directives are processed in the [order that they appear](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_alias.html#order) in the configuration file. Be careful that your `prefix` and `regex` entries do not conflict with your other entries. The YAML-to-Apache translation preserves the order of entries, so you can control the order of processing, but it's best to avoid conflicts.


## Custom Term Browsers

If your project does not use Ontobee as a term browser, you must specify `term_browser: custom` in your project's YAML configuration file, and provide a `regex` entry in the [`config/obo.yml`](config/obo.yml) configuration file. Here's an example for [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/):

    # Terms for CHEBI
    - regex: ^/obo/CHEBI_(\d+)$
      replacement: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:$1
      tests:
      - from: /CHEBI_15377
        to: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:15377

Note that term redirect rules are case sensitive.

Since these are `regex` entries, and could affect multiple projects, we prefer that OBO admins are the only ones to edit `obo.yml`. If you need a change to the term redirect entry for your project, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/issues/new).


## Migrating Configuration

OBO projects currently use OCLC for managing PURLs. This project aims to replace OCLC in a straightforward way.

The `Makefile` contains some code for fetching the PURL records for a given ontology ID from OCLC in XML format, and converting the XML to YAML. This should be a one-time migration, and it requires some manual editing and checking. Going forward, the YAML configuration should be edited directly.

The order of the migrated entries is: `exact` first (*should* be in the order they were created), followed by `prefix` entries from longest `prefix` to shortest. This order avoids nasty conflicts and has been tested to preserve the OCLC behaviour.

You can run migration for a single ontology at a time, by its ID (usually lower case):

    make migrate-obi

The tool will refuse to overwrite existing YAML configuration files. If you are running a test server (see next section) you can test the configuration as you are migrating:

    make migrate-obi && make all test


## Development and Testing

Developers can test their changes using a local virtual machine. First install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). Then check out a copy of this repository and start a virtual machine like so:

    git clone https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org.git
    cd purl.obolibrary.org/tools
    vagrant up

This will download a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine, start it, and configure it as a web server. The `/var/www/purl.obolibrary.org` directory of the VM is synced with your local `purl.obolibrary.org` directory. You can then log in and rebuild the `.htaccess` files:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/www/purl.obolibrary.org
    make

Test your changes in your browser using URLs starting with `http://172.16.100.10/obo/`, such as [`http://172.16.100.10/obo/OBI_0000070`](http://172.16.100.10/obo/OBI_0000070). You can also run an automated test of all the configured URLs like so:

    make all test

Test results will be listed in `tests/development/*.tsv` with their expected and actual values. If you are making changes to the project tools, you can test them against the `tools/examples/` files with:

    make clean test-examples

When you are done with the VM, log out with `exit`. Then you can choose to suspend the VM with

    vagrant suspend

or delete the VM with

    vagrant destroy

You can test against the production PURL server using `make test-production`. We only make one request per second, to avoid abusing the server, so this can take along time.


## Deployment

Deployment is automated using [Ansible](http://ansible.com), and targets a stock Ubuntu Linux server. You should install on a **fresh** server, not one that's running other applications, unless you **really** know what you're doing.

Install Ansible on your local machine, add the IP address or hostname of your target server to `tools/hosts`, then run:

    cd tools
    ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

Ansible uses SSH to connect to the server an execute the tasks in [`tools/site.yml`](tools/site.yml). If you have trouble connecting, you may have to adjust your SSH configuration to be more automatic, say by editing your `.ssh/config`.

You can re-run Ansible as you make changes. Once the system is running, it will fetch changes from the master Git repository every 10 minutes. From your local machine, you can test all URLs against any target server, e.g.:

    export PRODUCTION=url.ontodev.org; make clean test-production

The `make safe-update` task will check [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org) to ensure that the latest build on the master branch passed all automated tests, and that it is newer than the last time `safe-update` completed. Then it will pull from the Git repository and rebuild the site. This *should* be safe for a `cron` task to synchronize PURLs with the repository.
